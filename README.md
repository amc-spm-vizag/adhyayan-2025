# Health Basket Challenge: Crafting Nutrition on a Budget! üçéüí∞

## Overview

The **Health Basket Challenge** is an interactive, gamified learning application designed to educate users about balanced nutrition, budget management, and the impact of dietary choices on health, particularly in the context of diverse Indian demographics. Acting as community dietitians, players must "shop" for food items to create a nutritionally adequate and affordable one-day meal plan for a specific persona, while also addressing a unique nutritional deficiency.

This project aims to make learning about public health nutrition engaging and practical, highlighting the socio-economic determinants of health and the importance of mindful food choices.

## üåü Features

* **Diverse Personas:** Choose from 6 unique personas, each representing different age groups, genders, occupations, and urban/rural demographics in India, with specific nutritional needs and budget constraints.
* **Virtual Market Simulation:** "Shop" from a simulated market stall with various food items, each having a price and detailed nutritional information.
* **Real-time Budget & Nutrient Tracking:** Monitor your spending and see how your basket contributes to the persona's calorie, macro, and micronutrient goals in real-time.
* **Deficiency Puzzle:** Each persona comes with a specific nutritional deficiency symptom to identify and address through food choices.
* **Interactive Scoring:** Receive a score based on nutritional adequacy, budget management, and success in addressing the deficiency.
* **‚ú® AI Dietitian's Review (Powered by Gemini API):** Get a qualitative, personalized assessment of your meal plan, including constructive feedback, suggestions for improvement, and practical meal ideas from your chosen ingredients.

## üéØ Learning Objectives

1.  To apply knowledge of basic nutrition, calories, and macronutrient/micronutrient requirements for diverse populations.
2.  To plan a balanced diet for individuals with specific needs (e.g., pregnancy, diabetes, growth, high physical activity).
